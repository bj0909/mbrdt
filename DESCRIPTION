Description: The mbrdt package provides tools for designing multistage binomial reliability demonstration tests (MRDTs). It allows researchers and practitioners to simulate and optimize the costs of MBRDT designs, considering the multi-stage acceptance uncertainties and the potential subsequent costs of RDT, such as reliability growth costs and warranty service costs.
